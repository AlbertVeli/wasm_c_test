WebAssembly test. C -> WebAssembly w/o Emscripten.
Using only llvm + clang with WebAssembly target.

This is basically the copy example from this article and some glue:

https://depth-first.com/articles/2019/10/16/compiling-c-to-webassembly-and-running-it-without-emscripten/

Requirements:
 * llvm / clang with target WebAssembly

On gentoo, add to package.use:

*/* LLVM_TARGETS: WebAssembly

Also enable use-flag default-lld to depend on sys-devel/lld, or install
it separately.

If you get an error like:

wasm-ld: error: cannot open /usr/lib/clang/11.1.0/lib/wasi/libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32.a: No such file or directory

You need to install libclang_rt_builtins-wasm32.a. The easiest is to install
it pre-compiled from:

https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-12

The missing file is in the libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32-wasi-12.0.tar.gz
gzip. Unpack it and copy the .a file to where clang wants it to be.
In my case /usr/lib/clang/11.1.0/lib/wasi/. I had to create the wasi
directory first.

Another option is to compile the entire wasi-sdk from the same page
or download a pre-compiled wasi-sdk toolchain.

NOTE: Update submodules to get wasi-libc before running make

 git submodule update --init --recursive
 make

To try it out, start a test webserver with:

 python -m http.server

and visit http://localhost:8000/copy.html

Open up the javascript console (More tools->Developer tools in chrome).
You should see the following text:

copy.html:30  copy length 22
copy.html:31  copy Hello from JavaScript!

Now everything works and you can start writing your own WebAssembly
apps - in C - without Emscripten.
